## Description
This repo contains the material for the book [Physical Modeling in MATLAB](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/) by Prof. Allen Downey.

## Contents
The repo contains two directories and one .md file.

### docs
This directory contains the book, which is freely online available [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/). I worked with v4.0. Also, it contains an .md file with a few errata (I might be mistaken, since I haven't contacted the author).

### src
This directory contains the book's examples and my solutions to the exercises, organized per chapter.
