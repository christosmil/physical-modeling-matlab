## Description
This repo contains the material for the book [Physical Modeling in MATLAB](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/) by Prof. Allen Downey.

## Contents
The repo contains two directories and one .md file.

### docs
This directory contains the book, which is freely online available [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/). I worked with v4.0. Also, it contains an .md file with a few errata (I might be mistaken, since I haven't contacted the author).

### src
This directory contains the book's examples and my solutions to the exercises, organized per chapter.

## The 8 Theorems of Debugging
Throughout the book there are 8 statements referring to debugging, called Theorems. I would argue that they should be called Axioms, since no formal proof is given. Neverthless, they are extremely useful and can serve as a cheatsheet during both the programming and the debugging process.
1. Readable code is debuggable code.
2. The only thing worse than getting an error message is not getting an error message.
3. Be sure that the code you are running is the code you think you are running.
4. Error messages tell you where the problem was discovered, not where it was caused.
5. The best way to avoid a bug is to make it impossible.
6. The best kind of debugging is the kind you don’t have to do.
7. The worst bugs aren’t in your code; they’re in your head.
8. Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.
